# database.json

An python script to create a database for [FastAni](https://fastani.net/ "FastAni") using [AniList](https://anilist.co "AniList") and [theMovieDB](https://www.themoviedb.org "theMovieDB"). Thanks to tmdb for providing all the usefull episode metadata!

## To Do list

- [ ] Fix issues
- [ ] Merge into the main repo
- [x] ???

## Requirements

* [Files must follow the Plex naming scheme](https://support.plex.tv/articles/naming-and-organizing-your-tv-show-files/ "Files must follow the Plex naming scheme")
* [Python and pip](https://www.python.org/downloads/ "Python and pip")
* [Tabulate (pip install tabulate)](https://pypi.org/project/tabulate/ "Tabulate (pip install Tabulate)")
* [Requests (pip install requests)](https://pypi.org/project/requests/ "Requests (pip install requests)")
* [tmdbsimple (pip install tmdbsimple)](https://pypi.org/project/tmdbsimple/ "Requests (pip install tmdbsimple)")
* [An API v3 key for theMovieDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api "An API v3 key for theMovieDB")

## Usage

1. Install Python and pip

2. Clone this repo at the root folder

3. Run ``pip install tabulate`` and ``pip install requests`` or you could do ``pip install -r requirements.txt``

4. Open the ``config.py`` file with any text editor and replace TMDB_API_v3_KEY with your API key (PS: make sure the api key is quoted.)

5. Simply run ``python createJson.py`` in the root of your database

6. Use the CLI to select any anime the script may have problems finding

7. Use the json file generated by the script however you like
- P.S. When all the unknown anime are searched and found the script will save a database.json with this structure, it will also save another JSON file with all the known anime, so that on the 2nd run and onwards it won't search again for the same anime, only for the unknown ones.

## Variables you can change

All variables you can change are located in the config.py file. Most of them are self explanatory but here is what they do.

| Variables    | Description                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| jsonPath     | Where your generated json file is saved to, by default it's '\./database\.json'                                                                            |
| jsonConfig   | Where your saved configs are, by default it's '\./config\.json'                                                                                            |
| fileFormat   | The file format which info is collected from, by default it's '\.mp4'                                                                                      |
| tmdb.API_KEY | Your API key for theMovieDB, change this you your key. Make sure it's in quotes like this 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX' (replace the Xs for your key) |

## Naming Scheme

```
/Anime
    /Season {Number}
        Anime S{Number}E{Number}.mp4
```

Where ``{Number}`` is a full number, in other words an Integer.

```
S{Number} ==> S01 (Season 1)

E{Number} ==> E01 (Episode 1)
```

For Example:

```
/One-Punch Man
    /Season 1
        One-Punch Man S01E01.mp4
        One-Punch Man S01E02.mp4
```

## JSON Structure

The databse.json will look like this:

```json
{
    "83097": {
        "Seasons": [
            {
                "Episodes": [
                    {

                        "title": "121045"
                    },
                    {
                        "ep": "02",
                        "file": "/Anime/Yakusoku_no_Neverland/Yakusoku no Neverland S01E02.mp4",

                    },
                    {
                        "ep": "03",
                        "file": "/Anime/Yakusoku_no_Neverland/Yakusoku no Neverland S01E03.mp4",
                        "directory": "/Anime/Yakusoku_no_Neverland",
                        "season_num": "01",
                        "thumb": "/Anime/Yakusoku_no_Neverland/thumbs/83097_thumbnail_03.jpg",
                        "title": "181045"
                    },
                    {
                        "ep": "04",
                        "file": "/Anime/Yakusoku_no_Neverland/Yakusoku no Neverland S01E04.mp4",
                        "directory": "/Anime/Yakusoku_no_Neverland",
                        "season_num": "01",
                        "thumb": "/Anime/Yakusoku_no_Neverland/thumbs/83097_thumbnail_04.jpg",
                        "title": "291045"
                    }
                ],
                "pretty_title": "The Promised Neverland"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

It has the anilist id as the key entry, and inside it a json that has an array of seasons with their files.
